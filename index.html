              <p>A retired Chief Financial Officer, but recently diagnosed ‘creative-type’, I approach the on-line experience from both the right and left-brain.  Schooled in the full-stack of Ruby and Rails, I discovered a passion for front-end development and embarked on a self-study adventure to master the many components that contribute to a truly extraordinary user experience through a combination of clean code and an understanding of mathematical beauty.</p>

              <p>I learn from both construction and deconstruction and enjoy getting ‘under the hood’ of my favorite websites to see what makes them tick.  Though not a designer, I enjoy playing with color palettes to create the most powerful impact – be that in my home or in the digital environment.</p>

              <p>An avid writer, I blog about my early retirement, immersion in Las Vegas culture, and am a frequent contributor to TripAdvisor.</p>

              <p>In my spare time, there is a good chance you will find me at the nearest airport, maybe plane spotting, but usually embarking on another adventure to a far-flung spot around the world.</p>

              <p>Originally from Wyoming, but a New Englander at heart, my husband and I recently relocated to Las Vegas after 15 years in Boston in pursuit of cultural immersion and escape from the snow.  Wanderlust is never far from the surface and we are always planning our next trip.</p>
